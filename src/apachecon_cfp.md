#### Day One: Next Generation Cassandra Conference (NGCC)
NGCC (Next Generation Cassandra Conference), a one-day event for Apache Cassandra contributors and large system operators to meet, discuss, and plan future development in the project. NGCC will take place on **Tuesday, September 10th**.

NGCC is an advanced event targeted toward Apache Cassandra contributors and large system / platform operators. Content will focus on Cassandra internals and is geared toward those with detailed knowledge of the codebase and architecture. All are welcome to attend.

#### Day Two: Apache Cassandra Summit
The Apache Cassandra Summit, a one-day event for Apache Cassandra users to meet, network, and learn about what's new and what's coming in Cassandra. The Apache Cassandra Summit will be held on **Wednesday, Sept 11**.

The Apache Cassandra Summit is targeted toward a wider audience. Topics should be interesting and accessible to those whose first introduction to Cassandra is at this event, and those who have been active in the community for many years.
